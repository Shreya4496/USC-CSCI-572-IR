According to our findings, there is a 13.3% overlap between the results of the baseline search engine (Google) and the candidate search engine (DuckDuckGo). Google and DuckDuckGo have a low number of overlapping results therefore, DuckDuckGo performed worse than Google (the standard search engine). Despite the presence of overlaps, the correlation of the overlapping result ranks from the two Search Engines is negative. The average Spearman coefficient is -4.4115, showing that the overlapping findings are unrelated. Thus, we can conclude that the two search engines use different algorithms to rank the pages/documents. As a result, we expect varied ranking outcomes for the same query.
